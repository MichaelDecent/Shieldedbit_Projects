# Basic Calculator Program

This Python program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo) using the command line. It takes two values and an operator as input and provides the calculated result based on the specified operator.

## Usage

To use this calculator, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the program files.

3. Run the program using Python:

   ```
   python3 calculator.py
   ```

4. Input the values and operator in the format: `<value1> <operator> <value2>`.

5. Press Enter to see the result.

## Input Format

The program expects the input in the following format:

```
<value1> <operator> <value2>
```

- `<value1>`: First numerical value.
- `<operator>`: One of the following operators: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulo).
- `<value2>`: Second numerical value.

## Example Usage
